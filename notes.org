* <2018-09-21 Fri> circulator going haywire
occasionally the circulator goes haywire---with the valves very rapidly firing for a period of time before returning to normal
Nick has recorded a video of this
looking at pin 3 of the 555 timer, I can see that the square wave is normal...
we were not able o induce haywire behavior in the electronics shop---will have to keep an eye out moving forward
